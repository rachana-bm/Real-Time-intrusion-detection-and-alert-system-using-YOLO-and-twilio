# Real-Time-intrusion-detection-and-alert-system-using-YOLO-and-twilio
This project is an AI-powered security system that uses YOLOv8 for real time person detection within a defined area. When an intruder is detected, it triggers an audible alarm, captures evidence, and sends instant SMS alerts using Twilio. Ideal for smart surveilance in  homes, offices, or restricted zones.
